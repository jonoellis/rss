# An Adaptation Of 🦉 Bubo Reader for Jono Ellis to replace Inoreader
From [George Mandis](https://george.mand.is/2019/11/introducing-bubo-rss-an-absurdly-minimalist-rss-feed-reader/) and forked. Main change was to have all of the feeds in one list controlled from [here](https://github.com/jonoellis/rss/blob/main/config/feeds.json) and displayed [here](https://ellisrss.netlify.app/).
